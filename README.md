# **The Overlooked Statistic: Underdiagnosis Among Minorities**
### *Author: Stella Wright*

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
This project examines the prevalence of **ADHD diagnoses among children from different minorities** using data from the **2019-2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)**. The goal is to fully understand the effect that variables such as race, gender, and sex have on diagnosis rates. 

The findings in this project aim to challenge the common assumption suggesting a complex interaction between accessibility, awareness, and community healthcare resources.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**
- **Analyze ADHD diagnosis rates** across different income groups (low, moderate, high), sex (male, female), race.
- Identify **trends from 2019 to 2023** and explore possible influences (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).
- Present insights through **data visualizations and statistical analysis**.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**

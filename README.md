# **The Overlooked Statistic: Underdiagnosis Among Minorities**
## **Analyzing ADHD Diagnoses by Socioeconomic Status**
### *Author: Stella Wright*

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
This project examines the prevalence of **ADHD diagnoses among children from different income levels** using data from the **2019-2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)**. The goal is to understand whether children from lower-income families have **higher diagnosis rates** compared to those from higher-income families and explore factors influencing this trend.

The findings challenge the common assumption that higher-income families have better access to healthcare and, therefore, higher diagnosis rates. Instead, results indicate that **children from lower-income backgrounds have higher reported ADHD diagnoses**, suggesting a complex interaction between accessibility, awareness, and community healthcare resources.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**
- **Analyze ADHD diagnosis rates** across different income groups (low, moderate, high).
- Identify **trends from 2019 to 2023** and explore possible influences (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).
- **Examine socioeconomic factors** that may contribute to differences in diagnosis rates.
- Present insights through **data visualizations and statistical analysis**.
